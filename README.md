My Homelab

It Uses Proxmox as the VM.

The VMs I Use:
Cloud-Int with Ubuntu Server with Docker
Windows Server 2022
LXC Containers (Im trying to rebuild these one at a time into Cloud-Int with Ubuntu Server with Docker as I dident know the LXC containers all share a kernal with proxmox.)

Projects I use on are here, Check them out and Support the Projects:

2. Set Up some Automation like updates (Still nedd to figure out if IM going ot ivest my timme in Ansible or n8n).
3. Figure out a better storage solution thjen just 2 NASs (Maybe Tiered Storage Array).
