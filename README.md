# My Homelab

It Uses Proxmox as the Virtualization Platform.

# The VMs I Use Contain:
Cloud-Int with Ubuntu Server with Docker
Windows Server 2022
LXC Containers (Im trying to rebuild these one at a time into Cloud-Int with Ubuntu Server with Docker as I dident know the LXC containers all share a kernal with proxmox.)
